    <p>Tapioca (/ˌtæpiˈoʊkə/; Portuguese: [tapiˈɔkɐ]) is a starch extracted from the storage roots of the cassava plant (Manihot esculenta, also known as manioc), a species native to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil,[1] but whose use is now spread throughout South America.</p>
    <p>It is a perennial shrub adapted to the hot conditions of tropical lowlands. Cassava copes better with poor soils than many other food plants.</p>
    <p>Tapioca is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries.</p>
    <p>It provides only carbohydrate food value, and is low in protein, vitamins and minerals. </p>
    <p>In other countries, it is used as a thickening agent in various manufactured foods. Its confection is something common by indigenous groups.</p>
